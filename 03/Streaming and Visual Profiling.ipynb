Each time you profile, information in the timeline will give information supporting how you should next modify your code. Doing this will further increase your understanding of how various CUDA programming techniques affect application performance."

    "- The code base contains a for-loop inside `main` for integrating the interbody forces calculated by `bodyForce` into the positions of the bodies in the system. This integration both needs to occur after `bodyForce` runs, and, needs to complete before the next call to `bodyForce`. Keep this in mind when choosing how and where to parallelize.\n",
